CyberLepki - a program facilitating the labeling of drug packages.

webpage: cbrl.github.io

The program is developed on the following equipment:


-Raspberry Pi model B development board

-Brother QL-800 printer

-TP-LINK TL-WN722N USB Wi-Fi dongle


The program should work without problems on Raspberry Pi Zero W 512MB RAM (same SOC).

I used a latest "Raspbian" operating system.

Make sure you have Pillow and brother_ql package installed and RAMdisk launched.

If you have problems with printing, install printer drivers from the printer manufacturer's website.

If you want to save time, I will make the SD card image available for you. Just let me know through cyberlepki@gmail.com.
